0.24 BugMaster's mod 2 (2011-9-20)
merge 2 changes by Oka Motofumi (aka Chikuzen):
  added 128 KB file buffering for speed up
  use ffmpeg for huffyuv encoding instead of mencoder
added support for interlaced avs sources (it must be field-based instead of frame-based)
new option: -csp i420/i422/i444 for support of I422/I444 colorspaces output (AviSynth 2.6+ is required)
